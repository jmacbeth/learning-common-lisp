# lisp-intro-programming-activities
Materials for learning Common Lisp.

These Lisp programming activities are based on assignments from an introduction to programming course in Java (CS 131 at Fairfield University) and converted over to Lisp.  They were originally used for a summer independent study project (also at Fairfield).  For this reason the numbering is irregular (starts at 3, skips 4).  Also, you may occasionally see compiler warnings in the grading scripts.  Assignment #13 is still a work in progress.
